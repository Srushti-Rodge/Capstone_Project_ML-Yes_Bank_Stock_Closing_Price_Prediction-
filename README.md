## Summery-
This project focuses on predicting the closing price of Yes Bank's stock, a task complicated by the bank's recent challenges, including bad loans, fraud cases, and regulatory interventions. Utilizing monthly stock price data, the project applies various regression models to forecast prices and assess the impact of significant events. The goal is to provide valuable insights for stakeholders and support informed investment decisions amidst the bank's financial uncertainties.
## Objective:
Develop a robust predictive model to accurately forecast Yes Bank's stock closing prices, addressing challenges such as multicollinearity and the impact of significant events like fraud cases and regulatory interventions.

## Challenges:

**1. Multicollinearity:** Handling high correlations between independent variables to improve model interpretation and accuracy.

**2. Significant Events:** Accurately capturing the effects of events that influence stock prices.

## Performance Goal:
Achieve high accuracy, with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression model's 99% accuracy as a benchmark, to provide valuable insights for stakeholders and support informed investment decisions.

## Overall Goal:
Create a reliable model that enhances understanding of Yes Bank's stock performance and aids in making well-informed investment choices.
